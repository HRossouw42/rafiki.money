Retails checkout flows are used extensively in e-commerce from buying digital goods to purchasing physical goods. This 
guide is going to walk through completing a retail checkout experience using your Payment Pointer from Rafiki Money. 
This method would be analogous to using your credit card or checkout with Paypal for online payments.

Ensure you have created and setup your account as shown in [Getting Started](intro#get-started).

## Checkout Flow

1. Get your Payment pointer from [Rafiki Money](https://rafiki.money)
2. Visit [ILP Eats](https://rafiki.shop/checkout)
3. Select the quantity of items you want
4. Enter your Payment Pointer in *Payment Details* and click **Checkout** 

You will now be prompted to follow an authorization flow to authorize ILP Eats access to the funds for your order

5. Enter your Login details for your Rafiki Money account.
6. Details of the Payment is presented, select which account the funds should come from and click **Authorize**

The merchant, *ILP Eats*, will now be able to PULL the funds from your account according to the authorization.
